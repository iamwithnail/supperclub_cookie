10) Add the addresses/workplaces and find a place equidistant   (whereshallwemeet.com)
11) Add the Google Geolocation / places API
    - Map comes up, centred on SW1
    - Name in - autocomplete
    - Is there an 'onSelectEvent' from that form/embed?

13) Add an edit form  (django helpdesk form might be good for this?)
14) Install
15) Use S3 for the profile pictures.
